This is a project for CODE LOUISVILLE's full-stack javascript class that will hopefully be expanded to a fully functioning single-page web app for tracking and managing car maintenance.

--------------------------------------

Project requirements:

*use primarily MEAN stack
*use CRUD functions, minimum read and write
*comment code
*be responsive
*detailed steps how to start

--------------------------------------

Project Purpose:

Basically this is like a todo list for car maintenance.  

I want to eventually build it out to help better manage car maintenance going forward, where this would be the core data that drives the rest of the application.

------------------------------------------

How to start:

*download source code
*run npm install in project root folder
*run npm run dev in project root folder (or run nodemon server.js)
*go to localhost:3000 in browser
